# P-DQN: Parametrized Deep Q-Networks

This is an implementation of P-DQN, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to handle environments with discrete-continuous hybrid action spaces.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZhBF/ParaDQN.git
cd ParaDQN
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## To Do Tasks
[x] Edit README with Quick Start instructions
[ ] Add requirements.txt file
[ ] Add command line arguments for training script
[ ] Implement more efficient storage in Replay Buffer
[ ] Consider bounding and shifting action parameters (refer to DDPG practices)
