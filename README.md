# P-DQN: Parametrized Deep Q-Networks

This is an implementation of P-DQN, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to handle environments with discrete-continuous hybrid action spaces.

## Quick Start

```bash
python train_paradqn.py
```

## To Do Tasks
[ ] Edit README with Quick Start instructions
[ ] Add command line arguments for training script
[ ] Implement more efficient storage in Replay Buffer
[ ] Consider bounding and shifting action parameters (refer to DDPG practices)
